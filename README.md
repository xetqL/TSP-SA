# TSP-SA
Traveling Salesman Problem using Simulated Annealing in Python

# Description
Custom implementation of simulated annealing heuristic applied on the Traveling Salesman Problem

# Implemented Moves
Two moves are allowed:
1. City swap
2. 2-Opt

# Warning
Time to solution seems quite slow compared to litterature. 
Indeed, temperature schedule and other parameters tuning may speed up the computation of approximate optimal solution
